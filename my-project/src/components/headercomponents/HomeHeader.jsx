I have just finished my diploma in IT Support and I'm currently looking for work. If you have any opportunities please contact me on Linkedin or email address at glgclaridge@gmail.com</div>
      <div className="text text-xl font-bold font-IBMsans pt-3">This website was made for me to learn about Neubrutalism website design and making a window that changes based on a user’s decision. In the future I want to build a website based on a PC’s Desktop that can change based on a user’s decisions. This could include a taskbar, background images and icon styles. This website is currently a work in progress and will be gaining new features as I learn.</div>
      <div className="text text-xl font-bold font-IBMsans pt-3">I became interested in Neubrutalism when looking at multiple website developer’s portfolios and noticing common themes that I found out were from the Neubrutalism style. I used these websites and designs as references and took elements I liked to design this website in figma and build in react using tailwind.</div>
